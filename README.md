Lexicon Visualizer
==================

This is a script by Michael Leen and John Leen to visualize the link structure
of a [Lexicon game](http://www.twistedconfessions.com/confessional/index.php?n=Lexicon.HomePage).

Actually it's both more specific and more general than that: it's hardcoded to
operate on the particular MoinMoin wiki that we've run two games on, but it
could easily be adapted to run against any Lexicon game or even any wiki.
